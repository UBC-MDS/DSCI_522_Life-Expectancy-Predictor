# Project Description
This project will use the the Government of Canada open dataset  'Life expectancy, at birth and at age 65, by sex, three-year average, Canada, provinces, territories, health regions and peer groups' which was obtained here https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/00c99f50-4f07-4e8c-b61d-9e188a51ed82
The research question that we aim to answer through this project is to predict the average life expectancy of a population as of 2015 given their geography, gender, and life expectancy predictions from previous years, and we plan to answer this question using a linear regression model on the data. 
The first step is that we need to wrangle the raw data to only include the informative and relevant columns, and to tidy the data in a way that makes analysis possible. Some exploratory data questions we will answer are _________ and one exploratory data analysis figure that we will create is _______
Finally, after completing all necessary analysis to answer our research question, we will share the results as a table and as a plot, showing the predicted life expectancy as of 2015 for each geographic region.
