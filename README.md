# Project Description
This project will use The Olympics dataset, which contains basic information on Olympic athletes and medal results from 1896 to 2016. The data is from tidytuesday and was obtained here https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-07-27/readme.md.
The research question that we aim to answer through this project is to predict the medal that was won by an athlete given their sex, age, weight, height, team, season and sport.
The first step is that we need to wrangle the raw data to only include the informative and relevant columns, and to tidy the data in a way that makes analysis possible. Some exploratory data questions we will answer are _________ and one exploratory data analysis figure that we will create is _______
Finally, after completing all necessary analysis to answer our research question, we will share the results as a table and as multiple plots, showing the predicted number of medals for each category.
